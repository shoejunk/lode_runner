3. Gameplay Mechanics
3.1 Core Gameplay
Platforming: Precise control over running, jumping, climbing, and digging within grid-based levels.
Digging Mechanic: Players can remove blocks to create new pathways or trap enemies, dynamically altering the level.
Treasure Collection: Scattered treasures serve as primary objectives that also contribute to the player’s score.
Time and Scoring: Levels are timed, with bonus points awarded for efficient completion and skillful maneuvers.
3.2 Player Mechanics
Movement: Responsive controls for smooth navigation across platforms, ladders, and obstacles.
Abilities: Special moves (e.g., rapid digs, temporary speed boosts) that may be unlocked or activated through power-ups.
Lives/Health: A system that tracks player progress, with opportunities to gain extra lives or activate checkpoints.
3.3 Enemy AI and Behavior
Patrol Patterns: Enemies move along predefined routes but can alter their path based on player actions.
Chase Mechanics: When alerted, enemies increase their speed and change direction to intercept the player.
Trapping: Players can leverage the digging mechanic to block enemy paths or lead them into traps.
3.4 Objectives and Challenges
Primary Objective: Collect all treasures and reach the level’s exit.
Secondary Objectives: Time-based challenges, bonus puzzles, or hidden items that enhance the score.
Obstacles: Include moving platforms, destructible terrains, and enemy spawn points that challenge the player’s timing and strategy.
3.5 Scoring and Progression
Score System: Points are earned through treasure collection, enemy traps, and efficient level completion.
Difficulty Curve: Levels gradually introduce more complex puzzles, additional enemies, and new environmental hazards.
4. Level Design
4.1 Level Structure
Grid-Based Layout: Levels are composed of interconnected grids, allowing for multiple pathways and strategic choices.
Modular Components: Each level features modular sections that can be combined to create varied challenges.
4.2 Environment and Obstacles
Terrain Variations: Different types of terrain (soil, rock, etc.) that influence the player’s digging and movement.
Interactive Objects: Platforms, ladders, ropes, and breakable blocks form the core interactive elements.
Hazards: Traps, enemy spawn areas, and unstable sections that add tension and require careful planning.
4.3 Puzzle Elements
Logical Challenges: Players must plan routes and manage limited digging resources to overcome obstacles.
Environmental Puzzles: Use the surroundings to block enemies or open new pathways.
Bonus Challenges: Hidden puzzles that offer extra rewards or unlock additional content.
4.4 Difficulty Curve
Early Levels: Introduce basic mechanics with generous time limits and straightforward layouts.
Intermediate Levels: Present multiple enemies, branching pathways, and increased environmental complexity.
Advanced Levels: Demand mastery of mechanics with rapid enemy behaviors, timed challenges, and intricate puzzles.
5. Game Controls and User Interface
5.1 Controls
Keyboard/Controller Mapping:
Movement: Arrow keys or joystick for directional movement.
Jump: Spacebar or dedicated controller button.
Dig/Interact: Specific key (e.g., “D”) or controller button for performing the digging action.
Pause/Menu: Escape key or start button to access game menus.
Customization: Support for remapping keys and adjusting sensitivity.
5.2 HUD and Visual Cues
Score and Timer: Constantly visible score counter and remaining time display.
Lives/Health Indicators: Clear icons or bars showing the player’s remaining lives.
Visual Feedback: Effects to indicate successful actions (e.g., digging, collecting treasures) and enemy proximity alerts.
5.3 Menus and Navigation
Main Menu: Options include “Start Game,” “Level Editor” (if implemented), “Options,” and “Exit.”
Pause Menu: Allows players to resume, restart the level, adjust settings, or return to the main menu.
Options Screen: Provides controls for audio levels, video settings, and gameplay adjustments.
6. Technical Architecture
6.1 Game Engine and Tools
Engine: Select a 2D-friendly engine such as Unity or Godot to facilitate rapid development and cross-platform compatibility.
Development Tools: Utilize version control (e.g., Git), integrated level editors, and automated testing suites.
6.2 System Architecture
Game Loop: Structured into clear update, render, and input cycles.
Modular Design: Separate modules for physics, AI, rendering, audio, and user input to ensure maintainability and scalability.
6.3 Asset Pipeline
